# Portfolio Website (inspired by cyworld)

## 🧠 Motivation
This project is inspired by Cyworld, a popular Korean social media platform from the early 2000s. Known for its nostalgic aesthetic, personalized "mini-hompy" pages, and music playlists, Cyworld created a cozy digital space that felt uniquely personal.
I wanted to recreate that vibe while showcasing my own skills and background — blending nostalgia with modern web technologies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React.js – Core front-end framework
- Firebase (Firestore) – Visitor tracking and backend data
- React-Player – Embedded audio playback using YouTube sources
- Custom CSS – Pixel-accurate styling to replicate Cyworld’s retro feel

## 🚧 Sprint 1 – Initial Release
This is the first sprint of the project. <br />
Key features include:
- 📄 Multi-tab layout (Main, Profile, Projects, Resume)
- 🌎 Real-time visitor counter and geolocation tracking
- 🎵 Audio player styled in retro Cyworld fashion
- 📱 Mobile-optimized version for responsive access

## Planned for future sprints:
- Playlist system with multiple tracks
- Light/dark mode toggle
- CSS clean up

## NOTE
- Best desktop user experience in full screen (press F11)
